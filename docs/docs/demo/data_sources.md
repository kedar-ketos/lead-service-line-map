Our [demo application](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiN2VkNzY0MTktMDU4Zi00MzkzLTk2Y2YtOTJmY2E3N2MyYTk1IiwidCI6IjNhMzM0YmY0LThlNjEtNDNhOS04ZmY1LWFiYTQ0YzcxY2VhOCIsImMiOjZ9&pageName=ReportSection56a47a80c507793ad45d) has a few additional insights, not just service line-related. We stitched together different types of datasets in our model to make this possible.

Here are the data sources that we used:

2. Pittsburgh tax and property assessment data ([Source](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/property-assessments))
3. Pittsburgh neighborhood boundaries ([Source](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2))
