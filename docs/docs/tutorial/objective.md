The objective of this tutorial is to develop a map with insights to visualize the status of lead service lines.

By the time we finish this tutorial, we will be able to develop a reduced version of [this report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiN2VkNzY0MTktMDU4Zi00MzkzLTk2Y2YtOTJmY2E3N2MyYTk1IiwidCI6IjNhMzM0YmY0LThlNjEtNDNhOS04ZmY1LWFiYTQ0YzcxY2VhOCIsImMiOjZ9&pageName=ReportSection56a47a80c507793ad45d).

The datasets that we use will belong to a single city or a municipality. For the sake of this tutorial, we have chosen the city of Chicago. You may choose your own city or you can use the same datasets that are provided along with this tutorial. Although it's not mandatory to have the actual lead service line dataset, it is highly recommended. In the absence of this dataset, you should have the ability to generate dummy data randomly. We'll discuss in greater depth which dataset columns we need data for.

The tutorial is arranged in four sections:

1. Prerequisites: Everything that you need before you start building.
2. Get and transform data: What datasets to get and how to prepare them for visualization.
3. Edit Power BI: Connect your datasets to Power BI and make some minor configuration changes.
4. Publish: Publish your report to Power BI cloud.
