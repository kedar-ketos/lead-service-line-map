The objective of this tutorial is to develop an ibteractive report to visualize the status of lead service lines.

By the end of this tutorial, we will be able to develop a reduced version of [this report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiN2VkNzY0MTktMDU4Zi00MzkzLTk2Y2YtOTJmY2E3N2MyYTk1IiwidCI6IjNhMzM0YmY0LThlNjEtNDNhOS04ZmY1LWFiYTQ0YzcxY2VhOCIsImMiOjZ9&pageName=ReportSection56a47a80c507793ad45d).

The datasets that we use will belong to a single city or a municipality. For the sake of this tutorial, we have chosen the city of Chicago. Feel free to choose a different city or use the same datasets that are provided along with this tutorial. Although it's not mandatory to have the actual lead service line dataset, it is highly recommended. In the absence of such a dataset, you can generate dummy data randomly. We will discuss in greater depth which dataset columns we need.

The tutorial is arranged in four sections:

1. **Prerequisites**: Everything that you need before you start building.
2. **Get and transform data**: What datasets to get and how to prepare them for visualization.
3. **Configure Power BI**: Connect your datasets to Power BI and make some minor configuration changes.
4. **Publish**: Publish your report to Power BI cloud.
