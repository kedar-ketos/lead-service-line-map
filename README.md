Lead Service Line Map is a fast, automated way of generating lead service line maps. Utilities can build their own lead service line maps in three easy steps:

1. Get your datasets
2. Format data
3. Refresh the dashboard

It was developed by [KETOS](https://ketos.co) as a submission entry to the Water Data Prize 2021.


## Features

We combined the best practices used in the existing mapping solutions with newer proposals to improve these visuals. Specifically, we tried to address the three challenges outlined above - generalizability, rigidity in infrastructure, and difficulty in reading. Here are the significant features of our solution. We discuss each of these in greater depth in the subsequent sections.

1. Universal data model
2. Decoupled data storage and visualization layers
3. Share information in stages
4. User-friendly design and work-flow
5. Greater engagement with data
